There once was a little boy named Kevin who wanted to learn to be the best programmer 
in the entire kingdom of BeanLand. Java, the king of the beans however, wished his son,
Delpho, to be the most talented programmer of all, so he hid away the secret knowledge 
of an ancient mystical power known as GitHub. Without the use of GitHub, Kevin was powerless 
to compete with Delpho, and realized that he was outmatched. He grabbed his laptop and went to Github.com and started to work...
Through their easy to follow tutorials and simple user interface, Kevin easily became a master of GitHub.
His knowledge was great, and I believe that one day Kev will be able to fulfill his dreams as a God-tier programmer
