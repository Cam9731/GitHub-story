There once was a little boy named Kevin who wanted to learn to be the best programmer 
in the entire kingdom of BeanLand. Java, the king of the beans however, wished his son,
Delpho, to be the most talented programmer of all, so he hid away the secret knowledge 
of an ancient mystical power known as GitHub. Without the use of GitHub, Kevin was powerless 
to compete with Delpho, and realized that he was outmatched.
